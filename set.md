## Social Engineering Toolkit

you can install and run the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) on Ubuntu. Best practice: use the upstream TrustedSec repo (works on any Debian-based distro), or if you prefer a packaged route on Kali you can apt install set. Below are copy-paste commands and short troubleshooting notes.

Quick install (recommended: GitHub / upstream)

Run these in a terminal on your Ubuntu PC:

# 1) update and install deps
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y git python3-pip python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev
```

# 2) clone upstream repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit.git setoolkit
```
```bash
cd setoolkit
```

# 3) install Python deps and install/set up SET
```bash
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```  
# 4) installs into ~/.local by default
- run directly from repo (no global install required)

```bash
   python3 setoolkit
'''

- or, to install system-wide:

```bash
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

TrustedSecâ€™s GitHub README and the vendor page show the same approach.
